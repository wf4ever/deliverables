\section*{Executive Summary}
%Please enter Executive Summary
This deliverable describes the second phase of delivery of workflow
lifecycle management components. These components are focused around
the Wf4Ever Research Object Model (RO Model), which provides
descriptions of workflow-centric ROs -- aggregations of content. This
model is used to structure and describe ROs which are then stored and
manipulated by the components of the Wf4Ever Toolkit.

The RO Model provides a framework for describing aggregations of
content along with annotations of the aggregated resources, a
vocabulary for describing workflows, and a vocabulary for describing
provenance. The model did not undergo any major changes in the in the last year, which is a good sign as it suggests that the model is mature enough and captures user requirements adequately. 
We provide here a description of the RO model.
We also present the components developed for creating and managing Research Objects: the
RO Manager -- the
Research Object Digital Library. These components and services are also discussed in D1.2v3
(Wf4Ever Sandbox -- Phase II), D1.3v2 (Wf4Ever Architecture -- Phase
II) and D1.4v2 (Reference Wf4Ever Implementation -- Phase II). 

One of the main developments in the last year consist in incorporating research objects within the myExperiment environment to allow scientists who already use myExperiment to create, share and reuse research objects. We discuss the efforts that went into this task, and show how myExperiment is using Research Object Digital Library as a back-end for storing and archiving Research Objects.

We  present advanced management functions that we developed for abstracting and indexing workflows, with the aim of supporting the discovery and reuse of workflows. We present an ontology that we developed for abstracting workflows in terms of motifs that characterize data manipulation and transformation patterns, which we term motifs. We also report on a solution that we developed for indexing workflows based on the services (processes) that they use.

This deliverable should be read in tandem with D1.3v2 (Wf4Ever
Architecture -- Phase II), D1.4v2 (Reference Wf4Ever Implementation --
Phase II), D1.2v3 (Wf4Ever Sandbox -- Phase III), D3.2v2 (Design,
implementation and deployment of Workflow Evolution, Sharing and
Collaboration components -- Phase II) and D4.2v2 (Design,
implementation and deployment of Workflow Integrity and Authenticity
Maintenance components -- Phase II) in order to provide a complete
picture of the state of the Wf4Ever Phase II components.
