\section{Abstracting and Indexing Workflows}
\label{sec:abstract-indexing}

Using the research object model, one may use any vocabulary that fits their purpose. In this section, we provide two models that we developed for annotating workflows. The first one is aimed at abstracting workflows (Section \ref{sec:abstraction}), and the second at  indexing workflows (Section \ref{sec:indexation}).
