Reliability API: http://www.wf4ever-project.org/wiki/display/docs/Reliability+Evaluation+API

### User perspective

The main usage of the Reliability and Stability services is by using the RO Monitoring webapp. 
To see the monitoring of a RO users have a link in each of the ROs available in the RO Portal. 
They will have access to the complete trace of reliability in an easy an visual way. 
Apart from that, users will be notified by the notifications system by any variation in terms of quality of the RO.
Once the RO monitoring tool is opened, a graph containing quality information over time will be displayed. 
Users may have the opportunity to click on specific dates and get the checklist evaluation of that day, including a description and de possibility to compare it against a different point in time. 
As we can see in the following image, the points in the graph are in three different color (red, yellow, green) depending on the checklist results.
The descriptions of the checklist appear under the graph once the user has clicked on a date.
The option to compare two different dates or to analyze one day only is selected at the Combobox placed on top of the screen.

#### Survey

##### General usability:

* Visibility of system status. Does it give users appropriate feedback within reasonable time?
    * Yes. The results appear in a negligible amount of time, providing the needed feedback to the user.
* Match between system and the real world. Does it speak the user’s language and make information appear in a natural and logical order? Are implementation-specific details hidden from the user?
    * Yes. The usage of graphs makes the information understandable. Some concepts may require contextual knowledge but are presented in user's language.
* User control and freedom. Does it provide clearly marked exits, undo and redo?
    * Yes. The undo and redo are not needed in this application, but navigation is very intuitive.
* Consistency and standards. Is it consistent within the software, with other similar packages and with platform conventions?
    * Yes. The languange, interaction with other applications and style are aligned with the project standards.
* Error prevention. Does it prevent errors in the first place or help users avoid making them?
    * Yes. The application presents a set of information that doesn't allow users make errors. In case something could happen a message would appear in order to help users.
* Recognition rather than recall. Does it make objects, actions and options visible and reduce the amount of information a user has to remember?
    * Yes. The display and interface is clean and simple.
* Flexibility and efficiency of use. Does it offer short-cuts and support macros for frequently- done action sequences?
    * No. They are not needed.
* Aesthetic and minimalist design. Does it avoid showing irrelevant or rarely-needed information?
    * Yes. Only the needed information is visible.
* Help users recognize, diagnose, and recover from errors. Does it make errors clear, comprehensible, precise and suggest solutions if possible?
    * Yes. Errors are clear, but as it is an informative application the recoverability is not needed.
* Help and documentation. Does it provide concise, accurate, clear, easily-searchable task- oriented doc centred around concrete lists of steps?
    * Yes. There is information on the project main webpage and project wiki.
* Robustness.  Are responses sensible when instructions are not followed; e.g., wrong commands, illegal values, etc.?
    * Yes. The only possible of error is the retrieval of an inexistent Research Object, and a message would appear to inform about that.
* Obviousness. Can tasks be accomplished without any consultation of user documents or other material?
    * Yes. Everything can be used, but a introduction to the concepts would be necessary to understand the meaning of the presented results.

##### Release packaging:

* Are the binary releases packaged for immediate use in a suitable archive format?
    * N/A. Since it is a webservice with a web application, users do not need a binary release.
* Is it clear how to get the software from the web site? Does it have version numbers?
    * Yes, in case it is needed there is access to github to download the release, but version numbers are not used.
* Is it clear from the web site or user doc what other packages are required?
    * Yes, and they are included in the project.
* Is it clear what the licencing and copyright is on the web site?
    * Yes, it appears on the site.
* How to get started.  Is there a README, FAQ?
    * Yes, there is information at the project page.

##### User documentation:

* Are thererelevant user documents?
    * Yes, there are documents in the project page and wiki. Some of them have been provided at the begining of this section.
* Is the user documentation accurate?
    * Yes, it provides enough information to use the web application.
* Does it partition user, user-developer and developer information or mix it all together?
    * Yes, the information is separated.

    * Yes.
* Are there any supporting tutorials?
    * No, but everything is described in the documentation.
* If so, do these list the versions they apply to?
    * Not needed.
* If so, are they task-oriented, structured around helping users achieve their tasks?
    * Not needed.

##### Help and support:

    * No. There is no list of bugs.
* Is it clear how to ask for help e.g. where to e-mail or how to enter bugs/issues

    * No.
* If so, is there evidence of use?
    * Not available.
* Are they searchable?
    * Not available.
* Is there a bug/issue tracker?
    * Yes, a private one.
* If so, there evidence of use?
    * Yes, but not public.
* If so, does it seem that bugs and issues are resolved or, at least, looked at?
    * Depending on the bug.
* Is it clear what quality of service a user expect in terms of support e.g. best effort, reasonable effort, reply in 24 hours etc.?
    * No, there is no information in respect to that.
* Is it clear how to contribute bugs, issues, corrections (e.g. in tutorials or user doc) or ideas?
    * There is the possibility of using Github as a generic way.


### User-developer perspective

The user-developers will find that the project is very easy to set up. Libraries and references are included in the project and as long as external services work, the Stability and Reliability services will also work. The user-developers will need a Server to deploy the project and also an Eclipse IDE in case they want to change part of the functionality and/or customize it.

    * No, this information is not available.
* For services, is there information about copyright and licencing as to how the services can be used? e.g. for non-commercial purposes only, does the project have to be credited etc. Is there information on how any data can be used, who owns it etc.?
    * @@TODO
* Is the copyright and licencing of the software and third-party dependencies clear and documented so you can understand the implications on extensions you write?
    * @@TODO


### Developer perspective

The codebase of the application is written in Java, and the API is based on the use of RESTfull web services in the same line of other services developed for the project. The web applications uses javascript and jQuery. The code is available at Github and follows the recommended java best practices.
