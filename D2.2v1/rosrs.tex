\section{Research Object Storage and Retrieval Service}
\label{sec:rosrs}

The Wf4Ever Research Objects Digital Library (RODL) will provide a number of services that support the creation, management and manipulation of Research Objects (ROs). Among these services is Storage and Retrieval -- referred to here as ROSRS. 

The ROSRS is provided as a RESTful interface, with the following functionality:

\begin{itemize}
\item Storing and retrieving research objects;
\item Storing and retrieving resources aggregated within the research objects;
\item Annotating the aggregated resources, including the research object itself. 
\end{itemize}

The ROSRS uses the RO Model (as discussion in Section~\ref{sec:model} to structure and describe the objects it creates. 

Further information describing the details of the ROSRS API are contained in D1.2v1~\cite{D1.4v1}.
