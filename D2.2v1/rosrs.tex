\section{Research Object Storage and Retrieval}
\label{sec:rosrs}

The Research Object Storage and Retrieval API supports the creation,
management and manipulation of Research Objects (ROs). The Research
Object Digital Library provides an implementation of this
functionality. 

The ROSR API is provided as a RESTful interface, with the following functionality:

\begin{itemize}
\item Storing and retrieving research objects;
\item Storing and retrieving resources aggregated within the research objects;
\item Annotating the aggregated resources, including the research object itself. 
\end{itemize}

The ROSR API uses the RO Model (as discussion in Section~\ref{sec:model} to structure and describe the objects it creates. 

Further information describing the details of the ROSR API are
contained in D1.4v1 (Reference Wf4Ever Implementation -- Phase I)~\cite{D1.4v1}.
