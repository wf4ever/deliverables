\section*{Executive Summary}
%Please enter Executive Summary
This deliverable describes the first phase of delivery of workflow
lifecycle management components. These components are focused around
the Wf4Ever Research Object Model (RO model), which provides
descriptions of workflow-centric ROs -- aggregations of content. This
model is used to structure and describe ROs which are then stored and
manipulated by the components of the Wf4Ever Toolkit.

The RO Model provides a framework for describing aggregations of
content along with annotations of the aggregated resources, a
vocabulary for describing workflows, and a vocabulary for describing
provenance. We provide here a summary of the RO Model and its
accompanying documentation (the RO Primer), and highlight the services
developed for creating and management of Research Objects: the
Research Object Storage and Retrieval Service and a command line
tool. These components and services are described in greater detail in
D1.2v2 and D1.4v1.

We also discuss preliminary work in defining a model for workflow
abstraction, with the aim of supporting reuse of workflows (or their
constituent parts), and present an initial characterisation of
workflow decay, identifying causes of workflow decay based on an
analysis of existing workflows in the myExperiment repository.

This deliverable should be read in tandem with D1.4v1, D1.2v2, D3.2v1
and D4.2v1 in order to provide a complete picture of the state of the
Wf4Ever Phase I components.
