# 2. Provenance

- brief introduction to provenance

(sentence or two from PROV?)

## introduction to roles of provenance in Wf4Ever

(workflow results and RO evolution)

## provenance models and standards // (including trumpet blowing about completion of W3C provenance work?) 

  - Wrap up of the PROV activity and our role in this

(W3C stuff - summary of outcomes...)

## application to ROs

- How provenance can be encapsulated in an RO

(seems OK - note how wfprov is hooked to RO via annotation - provide schematic)

- How provenance can be consumed

(as part annotation graph; checklist; more?)
(check with Don how he intends to present workflow runs - sequence diagram?)

## Wf4Ever provenance corpus

(part of the ProvBench Corpus?)

## Taverna provenance export tool Â (plugin full explanation: sequence diagram from Stian??)

(Ask Stian)


## Provenance use-cases

- How provenance has been used in the project?
- How are we doing with provenance visualisation? (TODO: Esteban: to check with Stian and Raul about progress)
- Motifs/Workflow abstraction (differencing using templates vs. provenance) (GK:puzzled)
- Assessment of Kegg workflows ()
- Khalid and Stian are doing something (TODO Esteban: understand what exactly Khalid and Stian plan to do)
