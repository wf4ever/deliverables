# 2. Provenance

- brief introduction to provenance
- introduction to roles of provenance in Wf4Ever
- provenance models and standards // (including trumpet blowing about completion of W3C provenance work?) 
- application to ROs?? (Esteban)
  - How provenance can be encapsulated in an RO
  - How provenance can be consumed
- Wf4Ever provenance corpus (part of the ProvBench Corpus?)  This?: https://github.com/wf4ever/provenance-corpus
- Taverna provenance export tool  (plugin full explanation: sequence diagram from Stian??)

Key points:

- Wrap up of the PROV activity and our role in this
- How provenance has been used in the project?
- How are we doing with provenance visualisation? (TODO: Esteban: to check with Stian and Raul about progress)
- Motifs/Workflow abstraction (differencing using templates vs. provenance) (GK:puzzled)
- Assessment of Kegg workflows ()
- Khalid and Stian are doing something (TODO Esteban: understand what exactly Khalid and Stian plan to do)
