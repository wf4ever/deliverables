This diagram shows interactions between the checklist client (e.g. 
myExperiment), the checklist web service, RODL and possible other web resources 
(as determined by the checklist Minim definition).

The client interacts with the checklist service in two stages:
1. retrieve a checklist service document, which in turn contains a URI template 
for the checklist service.
2. invoke the checklist service via an HTTP GET with a URI constructed using the 
URI template from the service document.

The checklist service then interacts with RODL to retrieve the RO manifest and 
all annotations to a local copy.  These are then examined to determine whether 
all checklist items are satsified.  This may involve further interactions with 
other web resources referenced by the RO.
